# Hi

This is the personal website of Nianmin Guo.

I am currently a software engineer at Plaid. I had also interned at the Mass. Bay Transportation Authority (the T) as an internal tools developer in 2018 and 2019.

There is no app here (yet). Both hitori.io and htr.io were taken, I had no choice.

Ping me for Résumé \| [Github](https://github.com/Zenmai0822) \| [MBTA Work Github](https://github.com/nianminguo) \| `ng [at] hitori [dot] app`
